        # - spacecat and spacegrep are now the same executable. We only need
        #   the command (= executable file name) to be 'spacecat' to trigger
        #   the spacecat behavior.
        #   This can be achieved with a symlink or by copying 'spacegrep'
        #   to 'spacecat' at installation time. Spacecat is a utility for
        #   printing an AST, which is nice to have but not called
        #   by semgrep or semgrep-core.
        # - Use 'strip' to reduce the size of the semgrep-core executable.
        #   Its big size is due to large parse tables that support
        #   the LR(1) parsing algorithm used by menhir and tree-sitter.
        #   For tree-sitter, those are the 'parser.c' files generated for each
        #   grammar. We'll have more and more of such files, so the size of
        #   our static semgrep-core executable is expected to keep growing.
